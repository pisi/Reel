jQuery Reel Click-Free Stitched Panorama Example
================================================

This one demonstrates the option to have the interactivity set up
so that it can be manipulated only by moving mouse over it without any
clicking or dragging. It also is insensitive to the mouse wheel
interaction. It is a stitched rectilinear panorama image virtually
divided into 60 frames, starting on 23rd frame and animating itself
clockwise and very slowly with one full rotation per 20 seconds.

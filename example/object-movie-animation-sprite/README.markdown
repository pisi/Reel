jQuery Reel Object Movie Animation Sprite Example
=================================================

Object movie does't necessary need to depict the object spinning. As a matter
of fact any time-progressing sequence of frames like a short "movie" build of
individual photographs, time-lapse or a stop motion animation can be played
with Reel. This example depicts first 19 frames of Eadweard Muybridge's
"Animal locomotion. Plate 719" from the year 1877 (even though the plate
clearly features 20 frames). The sprite of footage 5 has a custom suffix
`-locomotion` and is animated with speed of 0.4 Hz (makes one full revolution
in 2.5 seconds).


Options Employed In This Example
--------------------------------

- [frame](http://reel360.org/reel#frame)
- [frames](http://reel360.org/reel#frames)
- [footage](http://reel360.org/reel#footage)
- [speed](http://reel360.org/reel#speed)
- [suffix](http://reel360.org/reel#suffix)

See the complete source of [index.html](index.html) for full
implementation.

jQuery Reel Directional Sprite Object Movie Example
===================================================

Reels are sensitive to direction of the interaction movement and can
optionaly reflect it. Note how the arrow in the example graphics always
points "forward". This is achieved by doubling the number of frames in
the sprite and using the first half for clockwise direction and the
second half for the opposite. This example starts at 3rd frame, plays
one second long opening animation, then pauses for 3 seconds and then
resumes a ongoing animation of one revolution per second.


Options Employed In This Example
